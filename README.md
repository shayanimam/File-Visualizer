### Tutorial
1. First, you want to copy the path that you'd like to visualize.
2. Open up treemap_visualiser.py and scroll down to the main function.

4. One entire rectangle represents either a folder or a file. It will be stated which of the two it is at the bottom of the screen along with its size in bytes. The bigger the size of the folder/file, the bigger it's rectangle will be. You can expand folders by selecting them and pressing 'e'. You can also expand EVERY directory within a selected folder by selecting it's rectangle and pressing 'a'.

5. This is what it looks like when I press 'a' after selecting my desktop. This shows every single file in my desktop. You can revert this back by pressing 'x', which will collapse EVERYTHING.
